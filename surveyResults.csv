I personally think it is just as important to communicate with each other about cool things we should share with each other as it is to communicate to the broader LTER community. A lot of people in LTER don't really know what IMs do beyond ""data management"" or how we can help. Blog posts (as opposed to a largely unadvertised) pdf provide a much easier mechanism for distributing specific posts more broader audience (e.g., via twitter), and even beyond LTER. Also, we IMs have a lot of skills that are becoming increasingly important skills for graduate students and early career scientists. Therefore, this is a great opportunity to rethink how we can share information that might be of interest to, as well as contribute to, the broader LTER Network (emphasis on ""Network""). I think the pdf model is very outdated. I'm not sure how to solve the problem of getting people to contribute. My excuse is lack of time. Where is the incentive?

I am not confident that content like SiteBytes and personnel updates lend themselves well to a blog so am not sure that those should carry forward; some of that content, like personnel updates, could be featured in the NCO or other newsletters (in fact, that is probably a better venue). It seems that the optimal niche for Databits is ideas that are not rich or fleshed-out enough for a journal submission but that would be of interest to the community, and that, ideally, could be developed into a journal submission. With that in mind, perhaps having content center on a pressing, emerging, or important theme would be an approach that would increase the utility of Databits and interest in the content."
